Hermes: Real-Time Data Acquisition Module for BESS-BMS (2024 - 2025)
</h3>
</p>

<p>
Hermes is a module designed to facilitate real-time data delivery from a BESS-BMS: 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Simulator developed through PySide to generate data that stands in for a BESS-BMS. Users were able to customize input that influenced the power generation and distribution.</li>
  <li>A grid of ESP32 development boards were configured for 4 way communication to pass on data, as well as process it by calculating averages.</li>
  <li>Cloud configured to gather the data and generate a KPI report.</li>
</ul>
