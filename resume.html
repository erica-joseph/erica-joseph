Hermes: Real-Time Data Acquisition Module for BESS-BMS (2024 - 2025)
</h3>
</p>

<p>
Hermes is a module designed to facilitate real-time data delivery from a BESS-BMS: 
</p>

<p>
<ul>
 <li>•   Led final project, observed and contributed to all parts. Practiced skills in communication, organization and
collaboration</li>
 <li>•   Developed Hermes, a module designed to facilitate real-time data delivery from a BESS-BMS using tools such as
C++, and Arduino
</li>
 <li>•   Created a Data Simulator developed through PySide to generate data functioning as a BESS-BMS. Employed tools
such as Python and Arduino IDE
</li>
 <li>•   Designed and assembled a grid of ESP32 development boards were configured for 4 way communication to pass on
data, as well as process it by calculating averages
</li>
 <li>•   Integrated Cloud configured to gather data and generate a KPI report using IoT Core and AWS</li>
 <li>•   Maximized outputs of system by integrating clever design loops in terms of pathing for each node</li>
</ul>
